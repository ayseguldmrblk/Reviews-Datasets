# Llama LORA Repository

This repository contains datasets and resources for training and fine-tuning AI models for llama-related text generation. We use TextGenWebUI, Hugging Face's Transformers library, and the LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning technique.

## Datasets

### `reviews_large.json`

- This dataset contains a large collection of llama-related text data. It's designed to be used for training large AI models, enabling them to generate llama-themed content with a broad vocabulary.

### `reviews_small.json`

- This dataset is a smaller subset of `reviews_large.json`. It's suitable for quick experimentation and testing of models. Use this dataset if you want to iterate rapidly during development.

### `reviews_large_alpaca.json`

- This dataset is an extension of `reviews_large.json` and includes additional data related to alpacas, which can be useful for creating AI models that generate content about both llamas and alpacas.

### `reviews_small_alpaca.json`

- Similar to `reviews_small.json`, this dataset is a compact version of `reviews_large_alpaca.json`. It's ideal for quick prototyping and experimenting with models that incorporate both llama and alpaca content.
